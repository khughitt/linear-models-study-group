Study Group: Linear models and GLMs
===================================

## Overview

This repository contains the notes for a study group held at the University of
Maryland, College Park from June 2016 - ...

The purpose of the study group is to obtain a rigorous understanding of the
basics of linear modeling, and eventually other types of related models such as
generalized linear models (GLMs).

To achieve this, we first plan to spend some time reviewing basic concepts from
linear algebra, statistics, and multivariate calculus.

For the linear algebra review, we have decided to use the 3rd edition of the 
Lay undergraduate textbook, [Linear Algebra and its
Applications](http://www.laylinalgebra.com/).

Once we have spent a bit of time reviewing important concepts there, the plan
is to move onto other materials such as Coursera course on linear modeling, or
a textbook on linear models / GLMs.
