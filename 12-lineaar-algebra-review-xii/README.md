### Unit vector

To create a unit vector divide a vector by its norm. The length of any unit vector is 1. Create unit vectors to normalize data.

## Orthogonal Vectors

Two vectors are geometrically perpendicular iff ![](img/perpendicular.png)

### Definition

Two vectors **u** and **v** in ![](img/Rn.png) are orthogonal (to each other) if ![](img/orthogonal.png)

**0** vector is orthogonal to every vector in ![](img/Rn.png)

### Pythagorean Theorem

Two vectors **u** and **v** are orthogonal iff ![](img/pythagorean.png)

## Orthogonal Complements

If a vector **z** is orthogonal to every vector in a subspace *W* of ![](img/Rn.png), then **z** is said to be orthogonal to *W*. The set of all vectors **z** that are orthogonal to *W* is called the orthogonal complement of *W* and is donated by ![](img/orthogonal_complement.png)

![](img/orthogonal_complement2.png)

1) A vector **x** is in ![](img/orthogonal_complement.png) iff **x** is orthogonal to every vector in a set that spans *W*.
2) ![](img/orthogonal_complement.png) is a subspace of ![](img/Rn.png)
